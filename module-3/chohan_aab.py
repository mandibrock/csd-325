Date: February 1, 2026
Assignment: Module 3.2

CHANGE LOG:
1) Updated input prompt from '> ' to 'aab: ' so it shows my initials instead of the default 
symbol.
2) Changed house fee from 10% to 12% to match new requirement.
3) Added a note to the intro explaining that rolling a total of 2 or 7 earns a 10 mon bonus.
4) Built in bonus feature so if the dice total is 2 or 7, the program tells the player
they hit the bonus and automatically adds 10 mon to their purse.
